# Testing Login and Dashboard Pages with Playwright with POM

This educational project demonstrates the use of the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern in Playwright. The website being tested is "https://demo-bank.vercel.app/", created by the skilled team at https://jaktestowac.pl/.

The purpose of this project is to compare the ease of implementation and clarity of code between Playwright and Cypress, with a focus on using POM for improved organization and maintainability.

It's important to note that this is just one approach to structuring tests and other developers may have different opinions on the best practices. However, the implementation of POM in this project is meant to highlight its benefits.

Please note that the code for the Cypress version of this project can be found at "https://github.com/Pawel-Albert/demo-bank-cypress".
